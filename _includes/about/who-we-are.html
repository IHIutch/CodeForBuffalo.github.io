            <h4>Local Civic Innovators and Creative Problem-Solvers</h4>

            <p>We are civic-minded residents committed to working with local government and the Buffalo community to make our region stronger. We’re here to help and eager to learn from professional public servants. While we’re advocates for open government (we can’t build apps without open data!), we’re non-partisan and public-minded.</p>

            <p>We are a group of organizers and activists, software developers and data scientists, designers and researchers, project managers and public servants, and many more passionate community members.</p>

            <p>We work in partnership with government, non-profit, and technical partners to deploy technology to improve quality of life for all residents. We strive to achieve this by helping enhance public services to be <em>better, faster, and cheaper</em> and have the greatest impact for the greatest amount of people who have the greatest need.</p>

            <h4>Diversity and Inclusion</h4>
            <strong>*Building a better Buffalo needs <em>all</em> of Buffalo.*</strong>

            <p>We welcome people of any gender identity or expression, race, skin color, ethnicity, age, size, nationality, sexual orientation, ability level, neurotype, religion, culture, political opinion, education level, and identity.</p>

            <p>In the wise words of Jane Jacobs,</p>
            <blockquote>Cities have the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody.</blockquote>

            <p>We welcome activists, artists, bloggers, crafters, coders, wannabe-coders, designers, entrepreneurs, journalists, teachers, ordinary people, extraordinary people, and everyone in between.</p>
