            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote border rounded p-4">
                <p>We build open source technology and organize a network of people dedicated to making government services simple, effective, and easy to use.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">We build civic applications by advocating for <a href="http://okfn.org">Open Data</a> policies and access that then empower residents to put data into new civic use-cases. </p>

            <p>
                We leverage technology as a tool to connect citizens with community resources and each other. These connections empower citizen-driven solutions to problems previously addressed only by top-down approaches. New forms of civic engagement help governments do more with less and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of public services.
